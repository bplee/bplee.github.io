Hey there, glad you made it! My name is Brennan, I do oncology research as a computational biologist at Bristol Myers Squibb. I came from a MS in computational biology at Weill Cornell Medical College. In undergrad I majored in Mathematics with Computer Science and received a minor in bio, but felt the desire to pursue my interests to the next level. Currently, I am a graduate researcher in the Leslie Lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering Research Center, where I work on Bayesian inference techniques and modeling under uncertainty.

Aside from being a student, I enjoy roller blading, magic the gathering, and teaching and practicing a traditional Korean martial art.
